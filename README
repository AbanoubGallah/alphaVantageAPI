# Cypress Tests for TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY API

This project contains Cypress tests for the `TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY` API provided by Alpha Vantage. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the API endpoints and ensure that the correct data is returned under various conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Cypress

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Configuration

The tests use a fixture file to store API details. Update the `apiTestData.json` file in the `cypress/fixtures` directory with your actual API key and any other data you wish to customize.

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://www.alphavantage.co/query",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY",
  "symbol": "IBM",
  "interval": "5min",
  "month": "2009-01",
  "invalidApiKey": "invalid_key"
}
```
Note: Never commit real API keys to version control.

## Running the Tests

To open the Cypress Test Runner, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

In the Test Runner, click on the test file you wish to run, and the tests will execute in a new browser window.

To run the tests headlessly, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

## Test Cases Overview

- **Test for successful API call with default parameters**: Validates that the API returns the latest 100 intraday OHLCV bars for the specified symbol and interval.
- **Test for successful API call with full output size**: Checks if the API retrieves the full 30 days of intraday data for the given symbol and interval.
- **Test for successful API call with historical month data**: Ensures that the API can retrieve intraday data for a specific historical month.
- **Test for error condition when required 'symbol' parameter is missing**: Confirms that the API returns an error when the 'symbol' parameter is omitted.
- **Test for error condition when invalid 'apikey' is provided**: Verifies that the API responds with an error when an invalid API key is used.


## Manual Test Cases

Test Case 1: Retrieve Intraday Data with Default Parameters

Title: Verify successful retrieval of intraday data with default parameters

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with the default parameters for symbol and interval.
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be 200, and the response body should contain the ‘Time Series (5min)’ property with data.

-------------

Test Case 2: Retrieve Full Output Size Data

Title: Verify successful retrieval of full output size intraday data

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with parameters for symbol, interval, and outputsize set to ‘full’.
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be 200, and the response body should contain the ‘Time Series (5min)’ property with a larger dataset.

-------------

Test Case 3: Missing Symbol Parameter

Title: Verify error response when ‘symbol’ parameter is missing

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint without the symbol parameter.
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be one of [400, 401, 403, 404], indicating a client-side error.

-------------

Test Case 4: Invalid API Key

Title: Verify error response when an invalid API key is provided

Preconditions: None

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with an invalid API key.

Expected Results: The response status code should be one of [400, 401, 403, 404], indicating an authentication or authorization error.

-------------

Test Case 5: Invalid Interval Parameter

Title: Verify error response when an invalid ‘interval’ parameter is provided

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with an invalid value for the interval parameter.
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be one of [400, 401, 403, 404], indicating a client-side error due to an invalid parameter.

-------------

Test Case 6: Retrieve Intraday Data for a Different Symbol

Title: Verify successful retrieval of intraday data for a different stock symbol

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with parameters for a different symbol (e.g., ‘AAPL’) and the interval.
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be 200, and the response body should contain the ‘Time Series (5min)’ property with data for the specified symbol.

-------------

Test Case 7: Retrieve Intraday Data with Compact Output Size

Title: Verify successful retrieval of intraday data with compact output size

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with parameters for symbol, interval, and outputsize set to ‘compact’.
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be 200, and the response body should contain a ‘Time Series (5min)’ property with a limited dataset.

-------------

Test Case 8: Invalid Symbol Parameter

Title: Verify error response when an invalid ‘symbol’ parameter is provided

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with an invalid value for the symbol parameter (e.g., ‘INVALID’).
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be one of [400, 401, 403, 404], indicating a client-side error due to an invalid symbol.

-------------

Test Case 9: Exceeding Rate Limit

Title: Verify response when the API rate limit is exceeded

Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send multiple GET requests to the endpoint in quick succession until the rate limit is exceeded.
Use the valid API key in the requests.

Expected Results: The response status code should indicate that the rate limit has been exceeded, which could be a 429 status code or another code as specified by the API documentation.

-------------

Test Case 10: Missing API Key

Title: Verify error response when the API key parameter is missing

Preconditions: None

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint without the apikey parameter.

Expected Results: The response status code should be one of [400, 401, 403, 404], indicating an authentication or authorization error due to the missing API key.

-------------

Test Case 11: Retrieve Intraday Data with Invalid Interval

Title: Verify error response when an unsupported ‘interval’ parameter is provided
Preconditions: Valid API key is available

Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the endpoint with an unsupported value for the interval parameter (e.g., ‘15sec’).
Use the valid API key in the request.

Expected Results: The response status code should be one of [400, 401, 403, 404], indicating a client-side error due to an unsupported interval.
